# GP ("Poetify")
The “Poetify” project tackles a specific challenge within Arabic poetry, with a focus on refining the processes of poetry generation, audio enhancement and speaker identification.
Arabic poetry holds immense cultural significance, serving as a timeless form of artistic expression and storytelling. However, accessing, understanding, and creating poetry can be daunting for many individuals, especially those new to this art form.
The challenge of data privacy and security in smart homes is Alexa. Which allows anyone to access and control her by using their voices. This is considered against privacy because the owners of the house are supposed to control it, not anyone else. So, we need to recognize the voices of the owners by using speaker identification.
